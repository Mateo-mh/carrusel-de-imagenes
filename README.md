# carrusel-de-imagenes
Using python and tkinter I made a basic image carousel

This is my third application in tkinter with python, it's relatively simple, to run the application just do the following:

1) clone the repository using "git clone plus the repository url"
2) through your terminal enter the folder called carousel-de-imagenes
3) Once you've entered the folder via terminal, run the following command: on Windows: python carousel.py - on macOS: python3 carousel.py
5) Done! You can now use this simple application
